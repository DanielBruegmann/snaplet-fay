* Typecheck with GHC (preferably let Fay do it)
* Test nested paths /fay-js/foo/bar.js
* Fay splice <script type="text/fay">
  * Print errors in HTTP response and in console
  * See built-in splices https://github.com/snapframework/heist/tree/master/src/Text/Templating/Heist/Splices
  * Check out heist posts on http://softwaresimply.blogspot.com
* Document configuration
* Why does Paths_snaplet_fay produce a warning?
* TODO has to recompile if dependencies (imports) changed, should perhaps skip compileAll mode?
* Log messages should print relative paths
* Option for not overwriting js files if they are newer than hs files (for debugging)
